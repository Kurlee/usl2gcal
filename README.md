# usl2gcal

## Purpose
I am a huge fan of the Charleston Battery. They are a soccer
team in the USL Championship league. I decided it would be nice to
have a small tool so scrape the league schedule from the USL website and 
creates a google calendar that I can have automatically imported into
my calendar. 

### Goals
 - Get more familiar with GO
 - Use Google API
 - Do this securely
 - Create a usable app that I can give to other USL team fans
